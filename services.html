    <h3>2. Registration Services</h3>
    <p>We facilitate easy online registration for various services related to job recruitment. Our platform offers a secure and user-friendly registration process for users to sign up for job opportunities, training sessions, and career guidance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Registration Fee:</strong> To access premium job listings, personalized services, or specialized career counseling, a small registration fee is required. Once the registration is completed, it cannot be canceled or refunded. Please ensure that you have reviewed all the details before making the payment.</li>

    <p>We do not provide refunds for the registration fee under any circumstances. However, in exceptional cases, if there is a technical error on our part, or if a service is unable to be provided as advertised, we will evaluate the situation on a case-by-case basis and may offer an alternative solution, such as a credit towards other services.</p>
    <p>In the rare event of a refund being applicable, the process will take <strong>5-7 working days</strong> for the amount to be credited to the customer's bank account.</p>
