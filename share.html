  <h1>Share & Earn - Reward Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Our Share & Earn program is designed to reward users who actively share our app with others.
    We believe in surprising our users, so the nature and value of rewards are kept secret until eligibility is confirmed.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Rewards may be gift cards, coupons, or other surprises.</li>
      <li>We do not publicly disclose the minimum points needed to request a reward.</li>
      <li>When users meet the internal criteria, a "Request Reward" button will automatically appear in the app.</li>
      <li>Users will be notified of rewards via the email used during account registration.</li>
      <li>Rewards are not guaranteed and are given as a gift, not as a withdrawal or cash equivalent.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Reward Request and Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    The system internally determines when a user becomes eligible to request a reward. This threshold (e.g., number of points) is subject to change without prior notice. The purpose is to encourage participation rather than create expectations of direct compensation.
  </p>

  <h2>No Cash Withdrawal</h2>
  <p>
    This program does not support any form of direct withdrawal or monetary payout. The reward is a discretionary gift from our side and should not be considered a contractual right.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to the Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to update or modify this Reward Policy at any time without prior notice. Continued participation in the Share & Earn program implies acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
